As an advocate for privacy, I am very enamored with the Tor Project, allowing users to retain their anonymity while using the Internet. And given that I have one of my Raspberry Pis lying around, I decided to help out the cause and convert my Pi into a Tor relay. My only complaint is with the speed of the Tor network, obviously because there are not enough volunteers donating their bandwidth, so this is my little way of helping out a great cause. 

## What is Tor?

## Setting up the Marvelous Pi
Being that I forgot my beloved HDMI cable on a recent trip to Chicago, I have been forced to resort to creative means to connect to my Pi. I am using my TTL-serial cable to connect to the pi.
